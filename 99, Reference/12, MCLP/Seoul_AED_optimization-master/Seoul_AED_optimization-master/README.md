# Seoul_AED_optimization

My team proposed this project to complement the weak emergency rescue system compared to the gradually increasing incidence of cardiac arrest in Seoul. 
In this project, we selected vulnerable points for cardiac arrest in Seoul based on demographics. 
Subsequently, we optimized the exact location for AEDs by using both heuristics and MCLP algorithms.
